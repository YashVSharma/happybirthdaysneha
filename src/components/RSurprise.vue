                       This is the First photo of your's that I ever Clicked. 17 September, 2017 -College freshers party.
                        I didn't know that day was going to be the turning point of my life, that day is gonna shape my entire college life. 
                        That day I saw a girl, and that was it. A glimpse of you is what all it took for me to fall head over heals for you. 
                        This photo was just an impulse reaction to seeing you on stage. Later that day, I mustered the courage to ask a girls name upfront,
                         just to be budged off by with that irritated reaction of yours. But it didnt end there, that's where it started. 
                         God knows what it would've been like if you'd have replied properly. 
                       But God had different plans for us. We might not be what we are now if it would've gone a different way that day.💝
                        I Love You❤️.

                       Your shunning me off didn't wasn't enough. Although I'm not one of the kind who walks up to a girl and ask her out at the first place, let alone being walked over just after that. 
                        But that didn't put you out of my mind either. I wanted to talk to you somehow.... Anyhow. I didn't had an Instagram account before I met you. I didn't see you much those days either.
                         But I wanted to. So I joined Instagram. Even then... I used to access insta through browser just to see if you responded to my request. 
                         I used to stalk your profile from ashita's phone. Ashita was always the key 😂😂 . But never did I ask her for any of your photos, nor your contact. I used to take screenshots of your photos and crop and recrop them.. Just to see your face.
                          This photo is one of many of your profile pictures 😂🤣.
                   Even I didn't expect anything of this sort from myself. You made me see the "Fanboy" me.
                    I Love You❤️.

                       And then started my Stalking days. Seeing you those days, even just a glimpse, used to make my day.And it has been the same since then. God has always been on my side.
                        But not each and every time though. This was the first.. And the last time, we were in the same room in the midterms.
                         Those were the best midterms I guess, even academically maybe.🤣🤣. I clicked this photo from a distance of 25ft I guess.
                          I know this is a serious breach of privacy, but I couldn't control my instincts seeing you seeing you stand in front of me. 
                       Again, it was a reflex to seeing you. Love makes you a creep sometimes too I guess. 😂💝
                        I Love You❤️.

                     After that Midterm, after seeing you for the first time, my craving for you was vs days graph was growing up proportionally (x=y)😛.
                      I used to send you requests, cancel them.. And again send them, hoping I'll be on top of your requests always, and you'll accept my request some day.
                       And then came February 2018. It was a month of great turmoil. I organized a whole goddamn event we a subtle thought of getting your attention somehow. But Bazinga was a massive failure 😂😂 . I'm happy you didn't come then. But it did wonders for me. 
                    It happened, it finally happned.. 15 Feb 2018 was the day us started.Dont know what thought struck your head, and you accepted my
                     friend request, but you did. I remember seeing that red dot of notification on Instagram, I saw your story was visible to me. I
                      couldn't believe that. I clicked the notification.. And Baammmm 💥 .. "Sneha mathur started following you". It was the best 
                      notification I've ever had on any platform.. Even Better than the time I got that mail for Google home. It was sooo unrealistic. My heart started pondering like hell. I couldn't belive what I was saying. 2 minutes later I was announcing parties for my friends,
                       parties to anyone I knew, people were literally sending me congratulatory messages. It was a real once in a life time experience. Those 5 months of stalking, requesting, creeping you out maybe... 
                  All of them were worth that moment. It was the best. This was Your story that day. 
                   I Love You❤️.

                  It had been 10+ days since you accepted my request. But I didn't do anything about it.. I sooo wanted to.. 
                  But I couldn't. I didn't know what to do yarr. I didn't want to mess up anything doing something stupid .
                   Afterall I waited for this moment to come for more than 5 months now. General procedure is to reply to your story, 
                   but you didn't put up a story yaarrrr. I was loosing my mind.. I had to do something. Then came 1st March. That life 
                   changing date. That holi day. That... HOLY day... It was in the afternoon, when .. Don't know  what happened.. I looked
                    up a holi wish photo(the coolest one I could find though😂😅) . Downloaded that photo.. And simply sent it to you without 
                    giving much thought. It was "Aar ya Paar" Situation for me. I didn't know much about insta then... People send posts and all... I.. Like an uncle... Sent you a photo. That was sooo oldschool. But it worked.. God kept on smiling upon me. You replied yaarrr. It was the second time in 15 days you had my heart skip a beat. Your notification made me loose my shit. I didn't know what to do. I started asking Tarun and Soumya what should I do.. What should I say.. . And what one can expect for a relationship advice from 2 single friends. I got suggestions like.. Usko pooch Choley Bhature ya momos. But thankfully I didn't take their advice. And Took things ahead on my own. From "How you doin" ... To I love you sneha...
                   I never even imagined for something like this. This was all a miracle. You are the Miracle. I Love You❤️.

                      This was the day we met for the first time "Actually". We talked face to face for the first time. My wait was finally over. We were having our midterms those days I guess. It was a Wednesday. We were dine with the midterms. We had are meeting fixed at the canteen. And just before that,
                       I was sweating like hell. I didn't know what would I speak. What if I can't speak anything. What if I don't look good. I did wash my face with a facewash I carried specially for that meeting. I'd combed my hair. I was so nervous. And it all went away just as I was walking towards you. There you were.. 
                       Standing with simran, with your neon green bag. Looking all beautiful and "Pretty pretty". We talked for 2 hours straight that day I guess. I missed my practice that day. I had rohit bhaiya shout on me that day... But anything didn't matter at all. I was drooling over your thoughts... 
                      Memories of that day. And Those were the first 2 hours of hundreads of hours to come, that pass in the blink of an eye. Every moment with you is nothing but a gift that I had craved for so long.. I can savour for the rest of my life. This was our first together photo ever. I Love You❤️.

                       We started talking day and Night. It was all so beautiful. It still is 😛. But those days had their different charm. We had become good friends. I knew everything about you now.. What happened in first year.. How you lost some friends. We used to be together in the free lectures. 
                       Waiting all day for that 1 hour with you used to be nerve wracking. We were becoming better friends each day. I didn't like clicking photos much. But I wanted one with you. It had been 20 days since we met. I wanted to show you off to people. That day I slipped it by you like we don't have 
                       a photo together. We need one. And you are to already great at taking photos. Not photos actually... Selfies. This was our first selfie ever. Football ground, Cs it block k peeche.
                        It was again a Wednesday. That's when we started capturing our memories. 🥰🥰🥰.I love You❤️

                      On March 24 , I had told you that I liked you. You didn't respond.But you didn't go away either. It was relieving. We were at 2 minutes when I told you. It was around 4:45 . And just after that, you had to go back at 5:30. We took a detour to college. We didn't talk about that after that. I was afraid you were going to block me after that... But you didn't. And everything went on. We had been out for a few times since we met... But we never went 'OUT' out. April 4 was the day. We had our passes made. It was a Wednesday and it wasn't easy to get the pass.  But we had to do it.😂This was the first time we went out. World Trade park... I think that's the place we've visited the most so far too. I don't remember if this was the time we went in an auto where you didn't bargain😂😂. Just rich people thing. We were soo lean and thin back then. Since then we've been out for a lot of times. But this was the first and most special one.An outing with you to Juneja is as good as an outing with you to shimla.😉. I love You❤️ ❤

                     This one's not a memory close to my heart. But it's a hurtful one. This was the first time I'd felt like crying for you. Vidhi pulled off a great prank on you. But it wasn't a hilarious one for me. It was very disheartening. She messaged you pretending to be a guy. One smarter than me, more vocal than me, more interesting than me. That day had my head bursted with all the hidden thoughts of insecurity and jelousy I never knew existed. I was in a weak position. I didn't own you.. We weren't committed , I just couldn't do anything. It was the first day I felt like crying. It was the first time that the thought of loosing you came across my head. Those were exam days. I was loosing my shit.
                      I took a sigh of relief just after knowing it was a prank. But that day made me realize what you mean to me.. What you are to me. And to this day... I'm not possesive or insecure for you... But the thought of being away from you makes my eyes watery. I Love You❤️

I used to have a dream to watch a movie holding hands. This was definitely not the one... But this was a start. This was the day I had that movie thought. We used to have that just friends thing back then. But whatever.. It all turned out for the best.😂❤️

                     This one's from 2 years back from today. Your birthday has been the most important festival for me for the past 3 years. I'm calling this a festival because I wait for this day almost the whole year, the excitement sky rockets just a few days before this day, and I start planning for this day waayyy earlyy. This was your first birthday with me. I wanted it to be special. I wanted it to me memorable. Although I realize now it was not very smart to buy things completely useless to you and giving away just those small messages. But it is what it is😂😂😂 . That day was not the best maybe. But it is memorable. The start was horrible with that activa and cake thing. But it ended up with you crying out of joy yaarrr. It is till date, one of the best moments in our relationship so far. Everything was done just to make that day a little memorable. And I'm happy it was.. You deserved waaayyy more than that.. And I could've done better, but that was the scope what 2 Yash from 2 years Back could think of😂😂😂 . I love you Sneha 💕

                     We had been good friends for wayy long now. It had been 7 months since we met for the first time. I had been in a relationship with you for more than a year now, you had just started feeling the same I guess. This was the day we went to Hungry Birds. Not a Big milestone in our relationship.. But this was the first time we were going to a party deciding we'll be wearing the same colors. This was a big step I guess🤣🤣 . We had unknowningly started doing stuff people in relationships do(in the beginning obviously 😂) . That was a fun day too. The ride to the college at the end of a day of having fun has its own charm yaarr. I enjoy that ride tooo. I Love You💝

                    This practice period for GVU was a supplement for our relationship to bloom yaarrr. You had just confessed your feelings for me. And we used to spend the whole day practicing. GVU was a blessing in disguise. Thses days were sooooo goodd. We were really connecting emotionally. And we were expressing our feelings. This was the first time that we'd Hugged yaarrrr. That hug was a mesmerizing feeling. A feeling so good.. I can't stop smiling imagning about that. We were to people just entering a real relationship. You used to be tired. We used to hug. It was sooo beautiful. 
                    And on that final day.. That ride.. Back from GVU.. After the competition... There is still no match for that. That was the most beautiful 15 minutes ride. It was dark and breezy. We were talking the whole ride. It was soo soooo beautiful. I was driving as slow as I can... Beacause I never wanted that ride to end. 
                    I don't want this Joyride of our relationship to end either. This is the most beautiful journey of my life, a journey I'd never want to reach its destination. I Love You❤️

We were spending almost all day together. We used to practice for Thirak. It was an experience of its own kind. We were together daily till 5 pm. No worries... No restrictions. We used to dance together... We used to practice together. But everything went on to be perfect after Thirak. The next day was the beessttt. We were with yoshit and tarun. At the terrace. It was soooo beautiful yaarrr. We ordered food. We had food together. Then we went on the top. The view itself was beautiful, but with you... It was a feeling I don't have words to express with. I wanted time to stop then and there. If anytime I get a chance to travel time and experience just the best moments of my life... That moment would be one. That feeling will always be close to my heart no matter what turns our lives take.I Love You❤️

It was the first time I was taking classes with you. But this was also a great times because we used to go around the city together. Those small trips to Chulgiri... Amer.. Nahargarh were fun. Fun enough to be the most enjoyed moments of my college life. And We didn't know... But our stars were aligned together complementing together. We looked like a couple. We didn't wear the same dresses on purpose but it used to happen so often to be called coincidents. Those little trips to GVD..  Ride back to the college. Everything was just turning to be in our favor. And on the last day... I got the chance to confess my love for you in front of the entire world... I took it. I wouldn't miss any.. Ever. I will prove it every time you'll ask me to. Because that's how much I love you.

                     Again came the best festival of the year... Your Birthday🎂. But this time wasn't gonna be the same as last time. I didn't want to give you anything useless. I wanted to make it better than the last time. But the starting wasn't so good.  That day too... My activa failed me 😪. But it was all back on track after that. We went to see that terrible movie Kabir Singh. It wasn't so terrible sitting next to you though😂😂. But this was special. We were sitting in the theatre... Holding hands this time. The day had finally come. It had come earlier with that local movie we went on to see... I don't even remember it's name😂. But your birthday was good. Or I should say it wasn't bad. 🤣. Nothing special happned on your special day. But I had plans😛 . And your cute dumbness let me get it through😂😂😂. And then we went on to that surprise place just after you lost complete hope from it. 
                    And your raction was... Soo priceless. It was sooo good.. Everything I had to do was worth it. And I'd do anything to get that reaction of yours again. It is soo satisfying.. And just makes my day anytime I see that video. 
                    Remember... You're worth everything I do... Wayyyy more than anything.. You deserve the best.. Because you are the best. I love you ❤.

                     After more than 1.5 years of us being together... Came this moment. I moment that will remain what it is... Always. I don't know if the word to use would be 'Historical'. 🤣🤣
This was a fun day. We were all dressed up. Looking dapper. You say you knew it would happen that day... But I swear I didn't plan on doing that. It was an amazing day. Definition of a perfect party. All of us went to a fancy restaurant. You were looking Haaawwwt in that black 1 peice. My head was rolling upside down seeing you that day. Then we went on to drinking and dancing our hearts out. We took 100s of photos that day. Dancing with you in my arms is a feeling out of the world. It was already a perfect day. But it went on to a historic day when we kissed for the first time yaaarrrr. It was not the first kiss. I was afraid like hell before and even after kissing you. I kept on apologizing later. But that kiss hit me hard. It was not what what it looks like in movies. But I was happy... It was an out of the world kind of feeling. And My first kiss was with you. It is a wish if God grants  .. I want my last kiss to be with you. I love you sneha 💕

I can always regret what we couldn't do there. But I'll never forget what we did. I never thought I'll ever get a chance to sleep hugging you are. It was soooo beautiful. I was not liking that you are not well and dozed all the time... But those 2 nights were beautiful. We didn't do anything. But it was beautiful sleeping next to you. It was beautiful watching you sleep. Cuddeling... Putting you to sleep... I never imagined it would happen. But it did. Taking care of you was my only priority. I didn't regret missing the fun because being with you was the real beautiful experience. Sleeping with you in my arms is heavenly.. And I could spend all my days doing that. I love you ❤

                     Pravah 2020 is the last most beautiful memory we carry right now. Things turned out the way none of us ever imagined. Those 6 days were the best days of 2020 yaarr. I wish those days come back sometime. Those days weren't planned. And unplanned things are always beautiful. I don't have the words to express those feelings.. And I can't explain them here for safety purposes too😂😂 . But yeah.. Those days were fun... Monday was fun... Ashitas function was fun... Wednesday was fun.. We went to a movie that I don't even remember ... Then went on the following days. Those were some amazing days and I wish for them to come back soon. That lake day was the best yarr. But I won't forget you chose 3 peices of panipuri over me. And the trip to.lake was .... I don't have the adjective for that. Then that ride back in prakhars car. Than that dance at abhay's flat. The more I think about those moments.. The more I crave for them. But these are the memories that got us through all this hard time yaarrr. And I thank you for making my life so beautiful. I love you ❤

                     This Qurantine has been the Hardest part of our relationship so far. We have never been so far from each other for soo long since we started talking yaarrr. And it all happned all of a sudden. We didn't even meet for the last time realizing this might actually be the last time we meet each other in more than  6 months yaarr. And the worst part of it is we don't even know how long it's gonna take for us to meet. I'll again never forgive you for choosing coffee over me 😑😑. 
                      But these months have been so hard yaarr. But I thank God I had you to get me through this situation yaarr. I don't know what it'd have been like without. I won't be having a motive without you yaaarr. Every single night I sleep thinking about you... Every morning.. The first thing that comes to my mind waking up is you. You've become the center of my world now yaarrr. My whole life is revolving around you. I don't know what it would be like this time next year. And even the thought of you going away is killing me. My whole life is gonna be like this qurantine yaarr... Not being able to meet you... And even worse.. Not been able to talk to you. I don't wanna think about it rn. 
                      What got me through this situation is you. These video calls are the proof yaarr.. I co-dependent we've become. And I want it to be the same.. Always. Only thing keeping me upbeat right now is the thought of meeting you this time and hugging you like I've never had. I'll never let you go. I love you💝
